Ultrasonic Sensor Based Location Tracking (Jan-April 2012)

This repository contains the C programs designed for the 8051 microcontroller P89V51RD2.

The ultrasonic sensor based location tracking system has 3 nodes - one master node and two slaves. 
For details of the working of this system, refer to the wiki pages.

Master_node.c : The C program running on the master node.
Slave1.c and Slave2.c : The C programs running on the two slave nodes.

This system was developed by Pranav N. Gour, Shantanu Bhate and Niranjan VK with inputs from Pramod S. as
part of Project SmartLAB in the period Jan-April 2012 in the Embedded Controllers Application Center at BITS-Pilani.
